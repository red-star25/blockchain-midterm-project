## Project Overview

CryptoZombies is an interactive coding tutorial that teaches users how to build Ethereum smart contracts with Solidity. For our midterm project, we developed a decentralized application (DApp) that allows users to create and level up their zombie army and kitty.

## Enhancements Implemented

1. **Deployment on Sepolia Testnet:** We deployed our smart contracts on the Sepolia testnet to demonstrate real-world blockchain interaction.
2. **Improved Website Design:** We revamped the user interface for a more engaging and intuitive experience.
3. **Creating Kitties Contract on the Backend:** We created a custom kitty smart contract to create new kitties on ganache locally.
4. **Automated retrieving the zombieOwnership contract address immediately upon its deployment on Ganache, eliminating the need for a hardcoded address in the frontend.**
5. **Migrated front-end code to use ReactJS**
6. **Allow users to create their zombies with custom names**
7. **Zombies cards are dynamically changed based on current user account**
8. **Added Autogenerated Images based on the name and ID of the zombie (used https://robohash.org/)**
9. **Each User can create up to 6 zombies**
10. **Used Latest Metamask Web3 API to connect to Ganache**
11. **Custom Script to fetch new and updated ABI from the build folder to be used in front-end**

## Installation and Setup

To set up and run the CryptoZombies DApp on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/sanjyot242/BlockChain-Midterm.git

2. Install dependencies:
   npm install

3. Install ganache and add this project to workspace using truffle-config.js file in the root directory

4. Connect your MetaMask wallet to the local network and import accounts from Ganache.

5. Deploy the smart contracts on Ganache:
   truffle compile, truffle migrate

6. Run the frontend application:
   npm run dev

## Deployment on Sepolia Testnet

To deploy and test on Sepolia Testnet, follow these steps:

1. Setup repo on Remix by importing it from Github:
   https://remix.ethereum.org/

2. Add Sepolia TestNet to Metamask, Details @ https://chainid.network/

3. To deploy ZombieOwnership contract, Go to Deploy section in remix, set the environment to "Injected Provider - Metamask", give your Metamask extension the necessary permission that it will ask when you change the environment.

4. After setting environment, select the ZombieOwnership contract and click on deploy, you can see the confirmation of deployment on console or you can check it on https://sepolia.etherscan.io/block/<block-id>,

## Technologies Used

- Solidity for smart contracts
- Truffle for smart contract deployment and testing
- Ganache for a local blockchain network
- Sepolia for a private Ethereum network
- Web3.js for blockchain interaction
- React for frontend development
